# Sounding_calculator

Sounding and tropospheric delay calculator

The program downloads sounding data from the Wyoming Weather Web site, calculates the tropospheric delay from the sounding, filtering out "bad" data with low upper measurements.

In addition, the program calculates the tropospheric delay according to the Saastamoinen model at the height of the GNSS station (as its purpose is to use with the tropospheric delay determined from GNSS observations).
